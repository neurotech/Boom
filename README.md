# Boom

Keep everyone informed of your critical hits.

`/boom` to toggle the addon on and off.

When Boom is on, you will automatically `/emote` a message informing anyone nearby of your critical hit - the amount, the spell name, and the target. Boom will also play a sound to keep you informed of your critical hits as well. *Boom has a 5 second internal cooldown.*
